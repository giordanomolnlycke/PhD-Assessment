The Mölnylcke.ipynb file analyzes the dataset associated with the article “Multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness and safety of hydrocellular and hydrocolloid dressings for treatment of stage II pressure ulcers in patients at primary and long-term care institutions.”  A statistically significant p-value of 0.1 was used for the entire analyses.  Initially, a statistical analysis was carried out between the type of dressing used and the other features in the dataset.  The objective of this analysis was to identify which variables have a statistically significant relationship with the type of dressing.  The 8-week exit period of patients based on the type of dressing was also calculated.  Subsequently, two clusters were created based on the cost of the two dressings: a more expensive cluster and a less expensive cluster.  At this point the type of cluster has been related to the other variables of the dataset (same procedure carried out previously with the type of dressing).  After that, the mean exit time from analyzes (associated with a healed ulcer) was recalculated.
